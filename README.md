Rules are a list of natural language clauses constructed so that the right-hand side of the clause is implied from the left-hand side of the clause, i.e. rules must be logical syllogisms. Left-hand sides and right-hand sides are key-value pairs and are thus one pair dictionaries. The left-hand side clause can have more than one part. In this case, parts are treated as being combined with the _AND_ logical operation and are syntactically separated by a comma. The _OR_ logical opeartion is not supported - a rule with the `OR` logical operation can easily be written as two rules having the same right-hand side, i.e. _IF_ **a** _OR_ **b** _THEN_ **c** is equivalent to _IF_ **a** _THEN_ **c** followed by `IF` **b** `THEN` **c**.
